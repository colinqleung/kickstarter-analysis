## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise is a playright who wants to start a crowd funding campaign to help fund her play, "Fever", and she is unsure on the logistics of the funding towards her cause. On the given Excel, we are given multiple criterias and characteristics of the funds provided for other plays. Through using the tools on Excel, we must determine which factors have the most significant impact that would make Louise's project's campaign successful. The insights formulated from Excel will inform us how to provide Louise with the best chance of success. The most significant varaible observed in the Excel table was the outcome columns which displyed which campaigns resulted in success, failure, or if it was canceled. The other columns inform other criterias which we analyzed to determine which of these factors were most associated with success.
